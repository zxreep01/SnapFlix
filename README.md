# SnapFlix - Premium Streaming Catalog

SnapFlix is a private, proprietary movies and TV shows streaming platform built with modern web technologies, offering a cinematic, Netflix-inspired interface to discover, track, and stream entertainment content.

## Features

- **🎬 Netflix Aesthetic**: Immersive dark cinema experience with dynamic Hero Billboard, Top 10 rankings, and high-contrast visuals.
- **🧭 Dynamic Discovery**: Real-time trending, popular, top-rated, and upcoming movies and series.
- **🍿 Minimal Popcorn ⇄ TV Loader**: one quiet, custom SVG shape-morphing mark used by every screen — route level loading states, lazy section fallbacks, query pending states and the player stage (no canned placeholder data, ever).
- **🔎 Instant Search**: Quick search capabilities across titles, actors, genres, and directors.
- **📂 Personal Watchlist**: Save favorites and track watch history securely.
- **💻📱 Fully Responsive**: Fluid desktop and mobile playback experience.
- **📲 Progressive Web App**: Optimized for desktop and mobile installation.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js 16 App Router**: Server and client rendering with optimal caching.
- **Tailwind CSS 4**: Modern styling with custom Netflix design system tokens.
- **HeroUI**: Component primitives tailored for high-contrast dark cinema aesthetics.
- **TypeScript**: Complete type safety.
- **TanStack Query**: Efficient client data caching and synchronizations.
- **The Movie Database (TMDB) API**: Dynamic movie and series metadata integration, fetched **server side** (server actions + cached `fetch`) so the token never reaches the browser.
- **Supabase**: Secure user authentication and database management.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Configure environment variables in `.env.local`:
   ```bash
   cp .env.local.example .env.local
   ```

   Every catalog surface (home carousel rows, hero billboard, Top 10, search,
   "Popular on SnapFlix", discover) is loaded from TMDB **on the server**, so at
   least one credential is required — a v4 read access token is recommended:

   ```bash
   TMDB_ACCESS_TOKEN="your_tmdb_access_token"          # preferred, server only
   # or
   NEXT_PUBLIC_TMDB_ACCESS_TOKEN="your_tmdb_access_token"
   ```

   If TMDB is unreachable or not configured, the affected sections show a
   retryable error state instead of placeholder titles.

3. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.
