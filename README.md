## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Configure environment variables in `.env.local`:
   ```bash
   cp .env.local.example .env.local
   ```

3. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## Deployment

The app ships to Cloudflare Workers through the OpenNext adapter, configured in `wrangler.jsonc`:

```bash
npm run build:worker   # next build + OpenNext bundle into .open-next
npm run preview        # serve the Worker locally through wrangler dev
npm run deploy         # deploy the Worker to Cloudflare
```

Wrangler runs the build script automatically before `dev`, `preview` and `deploy`, so Workers Builds needs no extra build configuration.
